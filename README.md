### Branching
- Create a branch:
```bash
git branch branchname
```
- Go to new branch:
```bash
git checkout branchname
```

### Fast-forward branching
- go checkout master branch
- Then merge other branch into master
```bash
git merge branchname
```

### Deleting branches
- Use the following to delete branches
```bash
git branch -d branchname
```
- When you delete future-plans, you can still access the branch from master using a commit id.
